The `Snippets API` is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

Snippets, or code examples, are helpful to show how a developer would use your API. Snippets can be used in documentation, tutorials, or blog posts where you want to show **how** to use your API.

A benefit of using Fern Docs is that snippets will automatically appear in your API Reference. Whenever your API definition changes, your snippets auto-update.
