The `Snippets API` is organized around REST. Our API has
predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded
request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses
standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

**Snippets, or code examples, are helpful to show how a
developer would use your API.** Snippets can be used in
documentation, tutorials, or blog posts where you want
to show how to use your API.

A benefit of using Fern Docs is that snippets will automatically
appear in your API Reference. Whenever your API definition
changes, your snippets auto-update.
